# PyTorch from Scratch in Python
Author: TJ Kim

## Objective
The objective of this directory is to recreate portions of PyTorch, using solely the numpy library. This was inspired by the deep learning course by Carnegie Mellon University which used various techniques in numpy to recreate PyTorch. I am using this as a stepping stone to further understand how machine learning libraries work and contribute to future iterations of PyTorch. 

## Future Iterations
* Create PyTorch in Mojo
* Create PyTorch in C++ (I'll do this once I set up my Linux machine)
